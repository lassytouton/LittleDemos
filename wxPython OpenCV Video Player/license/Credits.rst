wxPython
========

The following is copy of the wxPython license preamble::

    The licensing of the wxWidgets library is intended to protect the wxWidgets
    library, its developers, and its users, so that the considerable investment
    it represents is not abused.

    Under the terms of the wxWidgets Licence, you as a user are not
    obliged to distribute wxWidgets source code with your products, if you
    distribute these products in binary form. However, you are prevented from
    restricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the
    rights to use or distribute wxWidgets library source code in the way
    intended.

    The wxWidgets Licence establishes the copyright for the code and related
    material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
    modify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors
    for this or derived code.

    The core distribution of the wxWidgets library contains files
    under two different licences:

    - Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public
      Licence, version 2, with the special exception that you may create and
      distribute object code versions built from the source code or modified
      versions of it (even if these modified versions include code under a
      different licence), and distribute such binaries under your own
      terms.

    - Most core wxWidgets manuals are made available under the "wxWidgets
      Free Documentation Licence", which allows you to distribute modified
      versions of the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications
      made by you in your version of the library. However, you may not restrict
      any third party from reincorporating your changes into the original
      manuals.


The wxPython library uses the same license as the wxWidgets library it is
based on. The license text is::

    wxWindows Library Licence, Version 3.1
    ======================================

    Copyright (c) 1998-2005 Julian Smart, Robert Roebling et al

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this licence document, but changing it is not allowed.

    2. The exception is that you may use, copy, link, modify and distribute

    on the Library.

    3. If you copy code from files distributed under the terms of the GNU

    notice from such code and/or adjust the licensing conditions notice
